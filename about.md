## Getting Started
Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am from Cuernavaca, Morelos Mexico, I came to the United States when I was about 14. Unlike other people that come to this country, I came here without any prior any prior knowledge of the english language. within a year I found myself fitting into the culture.
What I really want to tell you is how my interest for computers started. In 2006 I bought my first computer, not from the store but at a garage sale since that was all I could afford. I bought the computer because I wanted to type out my homework to make it more presentable. Soon after I had enough money saved for a printer and bought it, right when I was installing it, a message showed up on the screen indicating I needed more space. I took it to a local computer repair shop, and they fixed my problem and my pocket too. I visited that same shop very often after that one time. each time it was for different reasons of course, lack of ram, memory, etc. ever since then, I became interested to see how it all worked out in reality. I was eager to learn about these magic machines... this is how my passion started.
